# A brief guide for setting up todo-machine
(But first, you can find a live version of this project here: [todo-machine](https://juanpaferro.github.io/todo-machine))

## Installation
It's super easy, you just have to clone this repo, move to the root of it and execute: 

`
$npm install
`

It had never been so easy, right?🤔

## Insights
So, now let's see what this app is for (It's kind of obvious) and what tools were used to build it.

#### What it is
If your first guess was that this is just another ToDo app then you are completely **right**. It also is a mobile-first and fully responsive app, and I think that's beautiful 

#### Tools used
- Let's start by the beginning: **React** (This app was built using `$npx create-react-app`)

- **React Icons** are used for the iconography

- The styles are powered by **Styled Components**
